# YouTubeCA shows YouTube video data for Canada in 2017. Capstone shows that like USA most people are viewing Entertainment and Music on YouTube insted of more serious topics like News & Politics. Also, more interestingly the report finds that publicity whether good or bad is good for business. Since, the video, "The Shape of 2017" ranked in first place for the amounts of likes, dislikes and comments it goes to show that if people view your video they are more likely to comment on it. Report also found that most views consisted of positive comments. Popular YouTubers PewDiePie and LoganPaul appeared in the report as well. Showing that although it seems YouTube is pretty generalized in content, the same searches are continually occuring. Fascinating to find that LoganPaul who PewDiePie is ranting about in his last few videos actually has less vuews then he does. (Intersting fact for the Gen Z and Gen NET people.) Lastly, report questions if the videos are being marked wrong since many things happened in 2017 or are people really not interested in viewing serious stuff on YouTube and use it as an escape instead. In addition, shows the power of YouTube in a search engine and optimization.
